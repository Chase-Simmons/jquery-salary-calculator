# Salary Calculator Project

## Description

Duration: 3 hours 21 minutes.

The Salary Calculator Project allows a user to input their employee information and store it, so that they can keep track of each employee's name, id, title, and salary. In this specific case the user is budgeting a monthly salary of \$20,000 and a visual update will reflect when the budget has gone above that amount.

What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

    the biggest issue I had personally was the [data-index] concept on the button. At first I just wasn't understanding it and couldn't get it implemented in my project. Eventually I went back and re-watched our lecture for the day to get a better understanding, and after re-watching it I got a better grasp on it, and was able to successfully implement it into my project.

## Usage

How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Fill all five input fields out [ First Name, Last Name, Employee ID, Title, Annual Salary ].
2. Submit the inputs by clicking the [ Submit ] button.
3. This will store and visually display each employee entry and update the total monthly spending.
4. You will now see a [ Delete ] button next to each employee. Clicking this will delete that employee.
5. If a employee is deleted they will be removed the the DOM, and the array that employee information is stored in.
